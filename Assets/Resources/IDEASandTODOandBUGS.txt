TODO
Implement the rest of the cards in the rules document -- nearly done?
Cards that are added to the hand by other cards
Allow persistance modules for units?

TODO FOR ALPHA V1
Pause menu - Can save/load game and quit to main menu/desktop
Improve AI --  (AI) synergy metadata?
More cards - need more cards in tiers
Starting deck choice? Or at least sort out starting cards
Better generation of opponent decks -- use more tiers, more curated, use synergies?
Better generation of rewards -- less duplicates? control types? somewhat defined reward packages?
Expanded cards that dont just appear in the centre of the screen.

IDEAS
Developing, multi-stage, contextual battles with non-binary outcomes
eg.
Siege battle:
2 rounds to break down the wall (one needed to pass), final round in city if successful, outside if not.
3 outcomes: win siege, forces repelled, forces counter-attacked.

BUGS
AI not using defensive formations order - 'Not a bug' since units gain 'cant attack'
	after the order and we then do not score their attack value.
