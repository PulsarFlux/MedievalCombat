TODO
Implement the rest of the cards in the rules document
Cards that spawn and only last as long as a particular thing is on the battlefield


IDEAS
Developing, multi-stage, contextual battles with non-binary outcomes
eg.
Siege battle:
2 rounds to break down the wall (one needed to pass), final round in city if successful, outside if not.
3 outcomes: win siege, forces repelled, forces counter-attacked.
